# Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLTK

One of the best link to reference for Sentiment Analysis is 

https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sentiment-analysis#using-python-with-the-natural-language-toolkit-nltk

I have used it as the primary reference.

To execute the SentimentAnalysis.py script, you will need at the minimum:

1. Python 3 (3.5 or higher is the best). Refer to https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download for installation guide.

2. NLTK (3.2.5 or higher). Executing "pip install --user -U nltk" from the command window (cmd) once Python is installed should work.
	 Pip is already istalled with Python 3.4 or higher.
	 Refer to http://www.nltk.org/install.html for installation guide if you encounter problems.

3. If it is your first time running Sentiment Analysis on the machine you are working with, execute the Installation.py script to download some more tools we will use for our sentiment analysis.

4. Have the excel worksheet ready for analysis. Note its name, extension type (.xls/.xlsx/csv) and the column number of the message to be analyzed as you will need to enter it during execution of the code, when prompted.
